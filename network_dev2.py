network.py
~~~~~~~~~~

A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using backpropagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.


I added a lot more,
